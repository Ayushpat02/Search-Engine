# Search-Engine
• Designed a system that stored the different books in the library by sorting them based on the book title, ISBN, and check-out status in C++ and vectors along with functions that resulted in the user having access to a library.

• The different parts included checking out a book, adding a book to the database, searching for a book, etc.

• Focused on the backend side of the program, where the function of the system was created for the user to access the library, such as finding a book, removing a book, etc.
